'''
Create a function called every_three_nums that has one parameter named start.
The function should return a list of every third number between start and 100 (inclusive).
For example, every_three_nums(91) should return the list [91, 94, 97, 100]. 
If start is greater than 100, the function should return an empty list.
'''
def every_three_nums(start):
  return list(range(start, 101, 3))

'''
Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters named lst, start, and end.
The function should return a list where all elements in lst with an index between start and end (inclusive)
have been removed.
For example, the following code should return [4, 23, 42]
because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed:
'''
def remove_middle(lst, start, end):
  total = lst[:start] + lst[end + 1:] 
  return total

print(remove_middle([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3))

'''
Create a function named more_frequent_item that has three parameters named lst, item1, and item2.
Return either item1 or item2 depending on which item appears more often in lst.
If the two items appear the same number of times, return item1.
'''
# other function of challenge
#Write your function here
def more_frequent_item(lst, item1, item2):
  if lst.count(item1) >= lst.count(item2):
    return item1
  else:
    return item2

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(more_frequent_item([2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], 2, 3))

'''
Create a function named double_index that has two parameters:
a list named lst and a single number named index.
The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in lst except for the element at index.
The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original lst.
If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.
For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:
double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
After writing your function, un-comment the call to the function
that weâ€™ve provided for you to test your results.

# other function of challenge
#Write your function here
def double_index(lst, index):
  # Checks to see if index is too big
  if index >= len(lst):
    return lst
  else:
    # Gets the original list up to index
    new_lst = lst[0:index]
 # Adds double the value at index to the new list 
  new_lst.append(lst[index]*2)
  #  Adds the rest of the original list
  new_lst = new_lst + lst[index+1:]
  return new_lst

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(double_index([3, 8, -10, 12], 2))
